How to help (CONTRIBUTING)

You can help in the following ways:
- Translations (NL/EN) — especially summaries and the timeline.
- Fact-checking — verifying consistency of dates, amounts, and descriptions.
- Anonymization guidance — how to publish evidence without violating privacy (including metadata/EXIF).
- Media / NGO contacts — workers’ organizations, investigative journalists.

Reports:
- Open an Issue and describe what it concerns (be specific: file/section + proposed change).
- Do not post personal data or unredacted documents/screenshots in Issues (IDs, addresses, phone numbers, emails, faces, signatures, BSN/PESEL, etc.).
- This repo/report is informational and evidence-oriented — it is not legal advice.
