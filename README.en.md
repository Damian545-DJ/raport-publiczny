# Intrixo B.V. – public (anonymized) report on alleged violations and the lack of an effective system response

**TL;DR:** We have strong evidence (payslips + audio/video recordings + correspondence), yet for months/years we have been hitting a wall. In practice, it seems that the institutional protection available to an agency can be more effective than the protection mechanisms available to workers. We publish this so the case does not “die in paperwork”.

**Status:** public version (anonymized)  
**Last update:** 2026-01-10  
**Purpose of the repo:** verification, visibility, and gathering support (legal/media/community)

> Important: this is an informational, public-interest publication. We describe facts and conclusions based on documents and recordings in our possession. Any statements about wrongdoing must be read as **claims/allegations**, not as final court findings. This repository is not legal advice.

---

## Why we are making this public

Because we see that without visibility:

- a case can disappear inside procedures,
- institutions can remain silent for weeks/months,
- a worker is left alone with evidence, costs, and stress.

Our experience is brutally simple: the evidence exists, but effectiveness is missing.

---

## Who this concerns (short)

This case concerns the temporary work agency **Intrixo B.V.** (previously **Voorneputten**) and the following areas:

- employment (including Phase C / indefinite contract and guaranteed hours),
- wages and deductions,
- leave and allowances (including holiday allowance / vakantiebijslag),
- reliability of records and data,
- accommodation and privacy (entry into a locked room),
- actions/omissions of legal representatives.

The public version is anonymized. Full evidence is provided to institutions/legal representatives upon request (without publishing sensitive personal data).

---

## What we specifically allege (key points)

### 1) Wages / settlements / deductions
According to our documentation, the agency may have:

- failed to honour stable employment conditions (Phase C / minimum guaranteed hours),
- failed to pay full wages during periods without work,
- paid wages late,
- applied deductions beyond permitted limits (leaving the worker below subsistence level),
- refused leave-related entitlements (in time and/or money),
- underpaid statutory allowances (including holiday allowance),
- maintained records in a way that raises serious concerns (corrections, inconsistencies, “disappearing” information).

### 2) Pressure and attempts to force signatures
Based on audio recordings (in our assessment), there was pressure to sign documents related to a “debt”, with elements of intimidation.

### 3) Privacy and safety in accommodation
Based on video recordings, third parties repeatedly entered an occupied, locked room (date/time visible), without our consent and without prior notice.

## Institutions and the lack of an effective response (our experience)

The matter has involved / was communicated to, among others:

- FairWork
- Juridisch Loket
- SNCU
- Orde van Advocaten (Dutch Bar Association)

At the same time, organisations the agency references in terms of certification/industry:

- NBBU
- SNF

— according to our documentation, as of **2026-01-10**, we have **not** received a substantive response to our letters from these parties, or the response was insufficient (for example, without meaningful verification of the evidence points we submitted).

---

## What we expect (concrete)

- Written responses from bodies that are meant to uphold standards (including certification and oversight).
- Independent verification of evidence (lawyer/NGO/journalist).
- Full and transparent recalculation of hours and wages.
- Clarification regarding accommodation (who entered, on what basis, where logs are, who had key access).
- Protection for other workers — so they know how to protect themselves and how to collect evidence.

- timeline,
