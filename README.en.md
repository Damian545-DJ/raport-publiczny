# Intrixo B.V. – public report (anonymized) on violations and the lack of real system response

**TL;DR:** We have strong evidence (payslips + audio/video recordings + correspondence), and despite that we’ve been hitting a wall for months/years.  
In practice it looks like **the agency is better protected than the worker**. We publish this so the case does not “die in paperwork”.

**Status:** public version (anonymized)  
**Last update:** 2026-01-10  
**Repo:** for verification, raising awareness, and gathering support (legal/media/community)

## Why we are showing this to the world

Because we see that without public attention:
- the case can disappear in procedures,
- institutions can stay silent for weeks/months,
- the worker is left alone with the burden of evidence, costs, and stress.

Our experience is brutally simple: **the evidence exists, but effectiveness is missing**.

---

## Who this case concerns (briefly)

The case concerns the temporary work agency **Intrixo B.V.** (formerly Voorneputten) and topics such as:
- employment (including contract/Phase C and guaranteed hours),
- wages and deductions,
- leave and allowances (including vakantiegeld),
- reliability of records and data,
- housing and privacy (entries into a locked room),
- actions/neglect of legal representatives.

> This public version is anonymized. Full evidence materials are provided to institutions/representatives on request.

## What exactly we allege (key points)

### 1) Wages / settlements / deductions
Based on our documentation, the agency:
- did not comply with the guarantee of stable conditions (Phase C / minimum hours),
- did not pay full wages for periods without work,
- was late with payments,
- exceeded permissible deductions (leaving the worker with less than the minimum to live on),
- refused holiday entitlements (in kind and in money),
- underpaid statutory allowances (including vakantiegeld),
- kept records in a way that raises serious doubts (corrections, inconsistencies, “missing” information).

### 2) Pressure and attempts to force a signature
Audio recordings show pressure to sign documents about an alleged “debt”, with elements of intimidation.

### 3) Privacy and housing security
Video recordings show repeated entry by third parties into a locked, occupied room (date/time visible on the footage), without our consent and without prior notice.

## Institutions and lack of real response (our experience)

The case is being handled by / the following have been informed, among others:
- **FairWork**
- **Juridisch Loket**
- **SNCU**
- **Orde van Advocaten**

At the same time, bodies the agency cites for certification / industry status:
- **NBBU**
- **SNF**

— according to our documentation, **as of 2026-01-10 they have not replied to our letters** (or the reply was insufficient).

---

## What we expect (concretely)

1) **Written responses** from bodies that should enforce standards (including certification and oversight).  
2) **Independent verification of the evidence** (lawyer/NGO/journalist).  
3) **A full, transparent calculation** of hours and wages.  
4) **Clarification of the housing issue** (who entered, on what basis, where the logs are, who had key access).  
5) **Protection of other workers** – so they know how to protect themselves and how to collect evidence.
