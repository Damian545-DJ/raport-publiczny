[English version]
Anonymization (ANONYMIZATION)

Purpose: the public version presents facts and evidence, but without publishing personal data or information that could identify private individuals.

What we remove / redact in the public version
- national ID numbers (e.g., BSN), document numbers, dates of birth
- private addresses, room/apartment numbers (if not essential), phone numbers, private email addresses
- bank account numbers and payment details
- handwritten signatures, signature scans, photos/faces of private individuals
- full details of third parties (e.g., reception staff, neighbors, random people in the background)
- indirect identifiers (e.g., employee numbers/system IDs, license plates, chat-app nicknames/avatars) if they can lead to a specific person
- file metadata (PDF/JPG/DOCX), including photo EXIF, edit history, author/computer identifiers, and QR/barcodes containing IDs

What we keep (because it is key for evidentiary value)
- dates and times of events (e.g., timestamps)
- company name and roles (e.g., “temporary work agency,” “legal representative,” “control body”) — without private individuals’ personal data
- payroll week numbers (week X), periods, and numeric amounts — without sensitive data
- document excerpts after permanent redaction (durable removal) of personal data

Audio/video
- In the public version, we do not publish materials that allow identification of private individuals (faces/voices/distinctive details).
- Full evidence materials are provided only to the competent institutions/authorities handling the case.

Safety rule
If in doubt, remove more rather than less. The public version is informational; complete data and the full evidence set are intended for institutions.
If anyone believes that identification is possible despite anonymization, please contact us so we can correct/remove the relevant content.
