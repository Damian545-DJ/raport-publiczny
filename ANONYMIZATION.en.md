[English Version]
Anonymization (ANONYMIZATION)
What we remove / mask in the public version
⦁	PESEL, document numbers, dates of birth
⦁	private addresses, room numbers (if not key), phone numbers, private email addresses
⦁	bank account numbers, BSN numbers
⦁	handwritten signatures, photos of faces of private individuals (except in a situation where publication is necessary and lawful – then consult first)
⦁	full data of third parties (reception staff, random people in the background)
What we keep (because it is crucial as evidence)
⦁	dates and times of events (e.g., on recordings)
⦁	company name and role (e.g., “agency”, “legal representative”)
⦁	settlement week numbers (week X) without sensitive data
⦁	excerpts of documents after personal data is redacted
Safety principle
If in doubt — remove more rather than less. Provide the full materials to institutions.
