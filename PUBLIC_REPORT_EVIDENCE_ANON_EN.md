## 0) Important reservations (fair and firm)

This document describes facts and conclusions **based on evidence in our possession** (documents, correspondence, audio and video recordings).

Terms such as “fraud”, “manipulation”, or “misleading” are used as **suspicions and the authors’ assessment based on presented facts**, and **not** as a final criminal-law judgment or a binding court finding.

This version is anonymized: names of private individuals, room number, name and address of the accommodation, and other identifying data were removed. The publication serves an informational and public-interest purpose and is not legal advice.

## 1) Case summary (core)

The case concerns **allegations** of serious issues regarding employment and settlements, including:

- Worker B being left without means of subsistence for nearly half a year (according to our documentation),
- a “housing debt” being accrued weekly and reaching approx. EUR 1,000 (according to settlements/documents),
- possible non-compliance with a Phase C (indefinite) contract with a 32-hour weekly guarantee,
- systemic payroll and settlement irregularities affecting Worker A (based on document analysis),
- pressure and attempts to force a signature during meetings with the agency (evidence: audio recordings),
- repeated entries by third parties into an occupied, locked room in agency accommodation (evidence: video recordings).

Additionally, the report describes problems with legal services: missing handover of key documents, long periods of silence, contradictory messages, and invoices without a clear breakdown of performed work (based on correspondence and billing documents).

## 2) Evidence (what exists and what supports it)

The authors indicate they possess, among other things:

- a court document (“proces-verbaal”) from the hearing dated 12 March 2024,
- audio recordings from meetings/conversations with the agency (pressure/attempts to force actions, according to the recordings),
- video recordings of third-party entries into the room in the accommodation (date/time visible on the footage),
- correspondence and contact traces (or lack thereof) with lawyers and institutions (including the Dutch Bar Association/Orde van Advocaten, the dean, the Disciplinary Board/Raad van Discipline, Juridisch Loket),
- payroll/settlement documentation (described in the source report as numerous and systemic irregularities).

**Technical note:** attachments in the GitHub repository should be published safely (redaction of sensitive data, no publication of bystanders’ faces, etc.). Full documents should be provided to institutions/legal representatives upon request.

## 3) Timeline (specific dates from the report)

### 3.1. Legal help and the court hearing
- Before New Year 2024: the authors seek accounting support; an accountant recommends Lawyer 1 (later: complaint to the Dutch Bar Association/Orde van Advocaten).
- 12 March 2024: court hearing takes place.
- According to the account: both sides had errors in calculations; the court was to allow time for accurate recalculation.
- The agency was to pay EUR 5,000 within a specified period (described as received “within 2 weeks”).

### 3.2. After the hearing and why the matter was not closed
- April 2024: meeting with Lawyer 1 – further steps were to follow once the agency sent full calculations; afterwards no visible progress.
- 24 May 2024: accountant informs that there is an outcome/decision and that Worker B should discuss it with Lawyer 1; based on email correspondence, contact with Lawyer 1 remained practically ineffective.
- June 2024: the authors hire Lawyer 2 (second office). They are told the case may take ~3–4 months and that contact will follow.

### 3.3. Lack of action / contradictory information
- After ~4 months: no updates; Lawyer 2 claims by phone they cannot obtain documents from Lawyer 1.
- 16 September 2024: authors ask the accountant to intervene regarding documentation; Lawyer 1 sends documents which, according to the authors, were not relevant.
- At the same time Lawyer 2 says “we received documents and are analysing them”, followed by silence again.
- After ~2 months: authors receive information that “a settlement exists and nothing can be done” (WhatsApp correspondence), and the document allegedly came from Intrixo – but it was not shown to the authors.
- Before New Year 2025: after announcing they would report suspected “fraud”, Lawyer 2 calls back; authors ask to obtain the outcome directly from the court – according to the authors, still without results and without reimbursement of paid fees; instead unclear “additional payment” invoices appear (authors describe this as a suspicion of improper billing).

## 4) Alleged labour-law violations – Worker B (Phase C, 32 hours)

According to the source report and documentation:

- Worker B was allegedly left without means of subsistence for nearly half a year.
- A “housing debt” was then accrued weekly, reaching approx. EUR 1,000.
- The agency allegedly failed to comply with the Phase C (indefinite) contract with a 32-hour weekly guarantee.
- Worker B was summoned to the office where, instead of resolving the matter, an additional abuse attempt allegedly occurred (authors state they have evidence).

---

## 5) Alleged labour-law violations – Worker A (systemic picture)

The source report describes systemic issues, including:

- failure to honour the Phase C minimum hours guarantee,
- failure to pay full wages during periods without work,
- deductions exceeding permitted limits (leaving the worker below subsistence minimum),
- refusal of holiday-related entitlements (in time and/or money),
- underpayment of statutory allowances,
- late wage payments,
- actions described as “manipulating documentation”, which the authors believe were intended to conceal shortcomings (stated as suspicion based on document analysis).

---

## 6) Pressure and coercion attempts – audio recording analysis

According to the source report and recordings:

- Worker B was summoned twice to confrontational meetings,
- during meetings there were attempts to force signing a document about cancelling the “debt”,
- the agency side allegedly used undue pressure and possibly veiled threats/intimidation (authors’ assessment based on the recordings),
- authors interpret this as an attempt to bypass Phase C guarantees and as an interference with free will and personal security.

---

## 7) Agency accommodation – third-party entry into a locked room (video)

According to video evidence, third parties repeatedly:

- opened and entered an occupied room in agency accommodation,
- even though the room was locked,
- without prior notice or consent,
- with date and time visible in the footage.

The report indicates at least four dates:
- 23 Dec 2024
- 08 Jan 2025
- 31 Mar 2025
- 02 Aug 2025

Total: 8 recordings.

**Evidence inference in the report:** this material may support requests to the accommodation manager for: entry procedures, a list of persons with master key access, entry logs/registries, and any inspection protocols for the specified dates/times.

## 8) Legal services – factual issues (no emotions, only facts)

### 8.1. Lawyer 1
- authors filed a complaint with the Dutch Bar Association/Orde van Advocaten,
- one allegation is insufficient information and failure to hand over key documents (neither to the authors nor to Lawyer 2),
- according to the authors, Lawyer 1 did not provide proof supporting their claims in response,
- the dean allegedly discounted part of the material due to missing translations; authors prepared translations and re-sent,
- the matter went to the Disciplinary Board; authors were informed the complaint was rejected due to “lack of translations”, although authors state the translations had been sent; authors filed an appeal/objection.

### 8.2. Lawyer 2
- accepted the case and payment; promised action within ~3–4 months; then long periods of silence,
- said they could not obtain documents from Lawyer 1,
- later stated “there was a settlement and nothing can be done” without showing the document,
- failed to obtain the outcome directly from the court despite requests,
- no refund of paid fees (per the authors’ email record) and issuance of unclear invoices.

- pressure and coercion attempts (audio),
- privacy and safety violations in accommodation (video),
- serious problems in legal services (missing documents, no contact, contradictory messages, invoices without clear basis).
