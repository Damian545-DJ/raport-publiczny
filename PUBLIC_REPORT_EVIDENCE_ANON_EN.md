## 0) Important notes (for accuracy and fairness)
1. This document describes facts **based on available evidence** (documents, correspondence, audio and video recordings).  
2. Terms such as *fraud*, *manipulation*, *misrepresentation* indicate **suspicions and assessments by the authors derived from facts**, not any final criminal judgment.  
3. This version is **fully anonymized**: names of private persons, room numbers, housing address and other identifying details have been removed.

## 1) Case summary (core points)
The case concerns serious labour-rights violations, including:
- leaving **Employee B** without means of subsistence for nearly half a year,  
- charging her a “debt” for accommodation that **increased weekly** up to about **EUR 1 000**,  
- breach of a **Phase C** (permanent) contract guaranteeing **32 hours per week**,  
- systematic payroll and settlement irregularities concerning **Employee A**,  
- pressure and attempts to force a signature during meetings with the agency (evidence: audio recordings),  
- repeated entries by third parties into an occupied, locked room in the agency housing (evidence: video recordings).

Additionally, the report notes serious issues with legal assistance: missing key documents, long silence periods, contradictory information, and invoices lacking clear breakdowns of services.

---

## 2) Evidence materials (what exists and what supports it)
According to the authors they possess, among others:
- a **court document (“proces-verbaal”)** from the hearing of **12 March 2024**,  
- **audio recordings** of meetings with the agency (pressure, coercion attempts),  
- **video recordings** showing third-party entries into the accommodation room (date / time visible),  
- correspondence and traces of contact (or lack thereof) with lawyers and institutions (including the **Orde van Advocaten**, the dean, **Raad van Discipline**, **Juridisch Loket**),  
- payslips / settlement records (described in the source report as numerous and systemic irregularities).

> **Technical note:** In the GitHub repository these materials should be attached securely (blurred sensitive data, no public release of third-party faces, etc.).

## 3) Timeline (key dates from the report)
### 3.1  Legal aid and court hearing
- **Before New Year 2024:** the authors sought bookkeeping help; the accountant recommended **Lawyer 1** (later subject of a complaint to the Orde van Advocaten).  
- **12 Mar 2024:** court hearing.  
  - Both sides allegedly had calculation errors; the court allowed time for precise recalculation.  
  - The agency was to pay **EUR 5 000** within a set period (“within two weeks”).  

### 3.2  After the hearing – why the case was not concluded
- **Apr 2024:** meeting with **Lawyer 1** – promised further action once the agency provided full calculations; then no progress.  
- **24 May 2024:** accountant informed there was a decision and that Employee B should discuss it with Lawyer 1; emails show contact still ineffective.  
- **Jun 2024:** the authors engaged **Lawyer 2** (second office), who said resolution may take **3–4 months**.

### 3.3  Lack of action / conflicting information
- **≈ 4 months later:** still no update; Lawyer 2 said he could not obtain files from Lawyer 1.  
- **16 Sep 2024:** accountant asked to intervene regarding documentation; Lawyer 1 sent some files – irrelevant per authors.  
- Around the same time Lawyer 2 stated “we received documents and are analysing”, then again silence.  
- **≈ 2 months later:** message that “a settlement exists and nothing can be done” (WhatsApp); the document allegedly from Intrixo **was never shown**.  
- **Before New Year 2025:** after the authors announced intent to report “fraud”, Lawyer 2 called back; they requested the court decision directly – no result and no refund of paid fees; instead unclear *extra invoices* appeared.

## 4) Labour-law violations – Employee B (Phase C, 32 h)
From the report:
1. Employee B was left without income for nearly six months.  
2. A “housing debt” was imposed, growing weekly to ≈ EUR 1 000.  
3. The agency breached the Phase C contract (permanent, 32 h/week).  
4. She was summoned to the office where – instead of resolving the contract – another form of abuse allegedly occurred (supported by evidence).

---

## 5) Labour-law violations – Employee A (systemic pattern)
Described as **systemic** irregularities:
- failure to guarantee minimum contracted hours in Phase C,  
- non-payment for idle periods,  
- excessive deductions (leaving pay below subsistence),  
- denial of holiday entitlements (in kind / cash),  
- reduction of statutory supplements,  
- delayed payments,  
- actions described as “document manipulation” to conceal deficiencies.

---

## 6) Pressure and coercion – audio-record analysis
Recordings allegedly show:
- Employee B was **summoned twice** for confrontational meetings,  
- attempts were made to force her to sign a document annulling the “debt”,  
- agency representatives applied **unacceptable pressure**, including veiled threats / intimidation,  
- authors qualify this as an attempt to circumvent Phase C guarantees and a breach of free will, dignity, and safety of the worker.

---

## 7) Agency housing – unauthorized entries (video)
Video evidence indicates that third parties repeatedly:
- opened doors and entered the occupied room,  
- despite it being locked,  
- without prior notice of inspection / maintenance,  
- with visible date / time stamps.

Reported dates:
- **23 Dec 2024**  
- **08 Jan 2025**  
- **31 Mar 2025**  
- **02 Aug 2025**  
Total: **8 videos**.

**Findings:** the material justifies requesting from the housing operator:
- entry procedures,  
- list of persons with key / master-key access,  
- access logs and inspection protocols for the listed dates / times.

---

## 8) Legal representation – factual issues
### 8.1  Lawyer 1
- complaint filed with the **Orde van Advocaten**,  
- allegations: poor communication / failure to deliver key documents to authors and to Lawyer 2,  
- Lawyer 1’s reply lacked supporting evidence,  
- dean allegedly disregarded some materials due to missing translations; authors provided them later,  
- case moved to **Raad van Discipline**; complaint rejected citing “missing translations” though translations had been sent; appeal filed.

### 8.2  Lawyer 2
- accepted the case + payment, promised outcome within 3–4 months, then silence,  
- claimed inability to get files from Lawyer 1,  
- later said “a settlement exists and nothing can be done” without showing it,  
- did not obtain the ruling directly from court,  
- no refund of fees + sent unclear invoices.

## 9) Legal basis (reference points – to verify)
Related Dutch provisions – for orientation only:

- **Wages despite no work** (*loon bij geen arbeid*): Art. 7:628 BW  
- **Statutory increase for late payment** (*wettelijke verhoging* up to 50 %): Art. 7:625 BW  
- **Holiday pay entitlement**: Art. 7:639 BW et seq.  
- **Presumed working hours** (*rechtsvermoeden arbeidsomvang* ≥ 3 months = average): Art. 7:610b BW  
- **Minimum holiday allowance (≥ 8 %)**: Art. 15 WML  
- **Housing deductions at minimum wage**: allowed only under strict conditions (written consent etc.) – Rijksoverheid rules  
- **Accuracy of data** – incorrect payroll corrections may breach Art. 5 GDPR

---

## 10) Conclusions
Evidence indicates:
1. serious labour-law breaches (Phase C / 32 h, deductions, non-payment, holidays, timeliness, settlements);  
2. pressure / coercion (audio);  
3. privacy and safety violations in agency housing (video);  
4. severe deficiencies in legal assistance (missing files, lack of contact, contradictory communication, unjustified invoices).
