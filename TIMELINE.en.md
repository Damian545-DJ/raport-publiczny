  # Evidence – start of the case (summary + timeline)

## 1) Debt mechanism caused by lack of work planning
From **21.11.2022** (indefinite contract, **Phase C**, **32h guarantee**), the agency created debt on the employee’s side by **not scheduling work** (e.g., while **housing costs** kept being charged).  
When work was later assigned again, this “debt” was **deducted from wages**, resulting in much lower payouts.  
In practice: **systematic creation of debt + recovery through deductions** (the debt remained in place practically until **27.05.2024**).

**Evidence:** screenshots/messages – repeated requests to schedule work.

## 2) Key dates (requests for planning / no response)
- **10.04.2023 (Planning):** question about work schedule — no response  
- **13.04.2023 (Planning):** question about work in the coming days — no response  
- **18.09.2023 (General):** question whether there will be work this week  
  - **18.09.2023 (Helpdesk – K.):** “I forwarded the information to the planning department.”
- **22.10.2023 (General):** another week without work — question when work will be available  
  - **24.10.2023 (A.K.):** “Planners are doing everything they can to schedule you.”
- **27.10.2023 (Salary/Payslip):** request for payroll document (Solaris week 42)

## 3) Evidence events (meetings/recordings)
- **13.11.2023:** summoned to the agency office (recording)
- **30.01.2024:** summoned again to the office (recording)
- **27.05.2024:** debt paid off

## 4) Findings regarding the debt
- From **24.07.2023** work was hardly scheduled at all, and the debt kept increasing.
- **25.09.2023** debt approx. **€1,000**; when work resumed, the agency started deductions.

## 5) External support and legal representatives (short summary)
### Lawyer 1
- 12/2023 – contact with accountant; recommendation of lawyer 1
- 12.03.2024 – court hearing; both sides present calculations; Intrixo pays €5,000; court sets a deadline for detailed calculations
- 04/2024 – meeting with Korver; no documents provided; next meeting arranged for end of May
- 24–30.05.2024 – no contact with the lawyer / information about vacation
- 23.06.2024 – consideration of changing lawyer due to lack of contact

### Lawyer 2 (MV Juridisch)
- 25.06.2024 – transfer of **€1,512.50** (FR2024-1127) to “M. Nieruchomości Investment B.V.”
- Promise to finalize within 3–4 months
- 07–09/2024 – no real actions and no status; difficult contact
- Autumn 2024 – court document (**proces-verbaal**) obtained independently; MV Juridisch did not obtain court documents
- 12/2024 – 01/2025 – requests for clarification/refund; refusal to refund, dispute about settlement of fees

## 6) Correspondence with MV Juridisch (WhatsApp) – attachments
- MV Juridisch relied on information “from management / the other side” that a settlement was concluded and “cannot be broken,”
- there is a suggestion that the representative “misled” and that “there is no appeal,” while we still lacked documents and clear explanations, and we ultimately had to obtain key documents ourselves,
- in 2025 we still request a copy of court documents and a proper case status.


  # Complaint against lawyer – Disciplinary Board (K077 2025 / Case 2485387)
## Main allegations

- **No reliable/complete information after the hearing on 12.03.2024**  
  After the hearing there should have been further steps (calculations/follow-up), but the client did not receive clear information about the end of the case, the settlement terms/agreements, or the final outcome.

- **Failure to provide court documents and case file**  
  Key documents (e.g., *proces-verbaal*, settlement/agreements, confirmations) were not delivered to the client, seriously obstructing any next steps.

- **Breakdown of communication / unavailability**  
  At a certain point the lawyer became practically unreachable despite repeated attempts to contact.

- **Claims that the “dossier was transferred” without hard proof**  
  There is no transfer list and no evidence of delivery/receipt of a complete set of case documents.

- **Risk that authorities assessed the case on incomplete material**  
  The correspondence explicitly states that translations and evidence were submitted later, with a request to include them in the file—creating a real risk that decisions were made on incomplete records.

# Employee 2 – case against an employment agency (anonymised)  
## Evidence + timeline (ZIP) – GitHub version (EN)

> Public version: no first/last names.  
> In the text I use: **Employee 2**, **Agency [A]**, **Client/Worksite [B]**.  
> Institutions (FairWork, Juridisch Loket, SNCU) remain.

---

## 1) Context (short)
- **Phase C** contract with **32 hours/week guaranteed**.
- Issues: work planning, hours/payslips, negative “balance/minus”, settlements and deductions (incl. housing).
- Vacation dispute: written information/confirmation of vacation hours vs later refusal + pressure/intimidation.
- After resignation: dispute over final settlement and payments.
- Support path: **FairWork → Juridisch Loket → SNCU**.

---

## 2) Key issues supported by evidence
- **“Minus/debt” mechanism** (e.g., housing charges/settlements) when work is not planned despite a 32h guarantee.
- **Payroll corrections/administrative chaos** (late corrections, questions “where did you work”, delayed payments).
- **Vacation (61.11 hours)**: first confirmed in writing, later refused + pressure to attend work.
- **Resignation + disputed/missing final settlement** → formal **demand for payment**.
- **SNCU**: file closed after correspondence with the opposing party.

I state that the last day of employment is **2025-08-10** and that I will leave the **agency housing** on the same day. Request for settlement of all outstanding amounts and either the possibility to use holiday leave during the notice period or **payment in lieu for unused holiday hours**.

  *(file: `Re_ Wypowiedzenie o prace - Poczta w Onet.pl.pdf`)*

- **2025-07-28** – Agency employee: instruction to **report to work the next day**, otherwise it would be treated as **failure to comply with the contract/notice period**.

- **2025-07-28 (16:52)** – Holiday leave: after renewed refusal, I send a formal demand; I refer to the earlier written approval from the planner on **2025-07-25**. I demand the possibility to use **61.11 hours** of leave from **2025-07-29** until the end of the contract and written confirmation of this decision. I indicate a breach of **Article 7:638 BW (Dutch Civil Code)** and announce a complaint to the **Dutch Labour Inspectorate (Nederlandse Arbeidsinspectie)** and legal enforcement of my rights.

- **2025-07-29** – Start of holiday leave until **2025-08-10**.

- **2025-07-29 (10:22)** – Agency employee: refusal – “not at the moment when you have already resigned” and the claim that I “did not receive approval anywhere” (denial of the planner’s earlier approval).

- **2025-08-03 (14:47)** – Correction/supplement: I inform Intrixo that in the planning app not all entries were saved correctly; I request urgent completion/correction.

- **2026-01-20** – SNCU / Juridisch Loket (signal **37856 / V-657**): Juridisch Loket reports that SNCU started a **preliminary procedure**, obtained consent to contact the employer, and after contacting the employer concluded it **cannot take further action**; the preliminary procedure was closed the previous week. Attachments include SNCU–employer correspondence and translations. Inspector: reporter has a **Phase C contract (32h)** and claims pressure to take leave instead of wages; difficulty establishing facts (possible leave initiated by the employee in weeks 31–32); request to the employer to verify and, if needed, pay missing hours. Employer: employee worked week 29 >41h, week 30 = 2.5h, week 31 = 1 day; **2025-07-28** was allegedly the last working day (employee allegedly reported a new job and did not return); according to the 4-week average he was paid correctly, so “no further action”.

- **2026-01-20** – Objection sent against **closing the case**, indicating what “evidence” they relied on – **no response**.
