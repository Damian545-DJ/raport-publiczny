- Growing employment and payroll issues, disputes over deductions and guaranteed hours (phase C).
- The worker was left without income or work for several months.

- During the case, an advance payment of EUR 5,000 was to be obtained.
- The court gave both parties time to provide accurate calculations.

 ## 07.2024 - Helpdesk/planner

- Lack of communication and updates.
- Information that documents could not be obtained from the previous lawyer.

  # Evidence – start of the case (summary + timeline)

## 1) Debt mechanism caused by lack of work planning
From **21.11.2022** (indefinite contract, **Phase C**, **32h guarantee**), the agency created debt on the employee’s side by **not scheduling work** (e.g., while **housing costs** kept being charged).  
When work was later assigned again, this “debt” was **deducted from wages**, resulting in much lower payouts.  
In practice: **systematic creation of debt + recovery through deductions** (the debt remained in place practically until **27.05.2024**).

**Evidence:** screenshots/messages – repeated requests to schedule work.

## 2) Key dates (requests for planning / no response)
- **10.04.2023 (Planning):** question about work schedule — no response  
- **13.04.2023 (Planning):** question about work in the coming days — no response  
- **18.09.2023 (General):** question whether there will be work this week  
  - **18.09.2023 (Helpdesk – K.):** “I forwarded the information to the planning department.”
- **22.10.2023 (General):** another week without work — question when work will be available  
  - **24.10.2023 (A.K.):** “Planners are doing everything they can to schedule you.”
- **27.10.2023 (Salary/Payslip):** request for payroll document (Solaris week 42)

## 3) Evidence events (meetings/recordings)
- **13.11.2023:** summoned to the agency office (recording)
- **30.01.2024:** summoned again to the office (recording)
- **27.05.2024:** debt paid off

## 4) Findings regarding the debt
- From **24.07.2023** work was hardly scheduled at all, and the debt kept increasing.
- **25.09.2023** debt approx. **€1,000**; when work resumed, the agency started deductions.

## 5) External support and legal representatives (short summary)
### Lawyer 1
- 12/2023 – contact with accountant; recommendation of lawyer 1
- 12.03.2024 – court hearing; both sides present calculations; Intrixo pays €5,000; court sets a deadline for detailed calculations
- 04/2024 – meeting with Korver; no documents provided; next meeting arranged for end of May
- 24–30.05.2024 – no contact with the lawyer / information about vacation
- 23.06.2024 – consideration of changing lawyer due to lack of contact

### Lawyer 2 (MV Juridisch)
- 25.06.2024 – transfer of **€1,512.50** (FR2024-1127) to “M. Nieruchomości Investment B.V.”
- Promise to finalize within 3–4 months
- 07–09/2024 – no real actions and no status; difficult contact
- Autumn 2024 – court document (**proces-verbaal**) obtained independently; MV Juridisch did not obtain court documents
- 12/2024 – 01/2025 – requests for clarification/refund; refusal to refund, dispute about settlement of fees

## 6) Correspondence with MV Juridisch (WhatsApp) – attachments
- MV Juridisch relied on information “from management / the other side” that a settlement was concluded and “cannot be broken,”
- there is a suggestion that the representative “misled” and that “there is no appeal,” while we still lacked documents and clear explanations, and we ultimately had to obtain key documents ourselves,
- in 2025 we still request a copy of court documents and a proper case status.


  # Complaint against lawyer – Disciplinary Board (K077 2025 / Case 2485387)
## Main allegations

- **No reliable/complete information after the hearing on 12.03.2024**  
  After the hearing there should have been further steps (calculations/follow-up), but the client did not receive clear information about the end of the case, the settlement terms/agreements, or the final outcome.

- **Failure to provide court documents and case file**  
  Key documents (e.g., *proces-verbaal*, settlement/agreements, confirmations) were not delivered to the client, seriously obstructing any next steps.

- **Breakdown of communication / unavailability**  
  At a certain point the lawyer became practically unreachable despite repeated attempts to contact.

- **Claims that the “dossier was transferred” without hard proof**  
  There is no transfer list and no evidence of delivery/receipt of a complete set of case documents.

- **Risk that authorities assessed the case on incomplete material**  
  The correspondence explicitly states that translations and evidence were submitted later, with a request to include them in the file—creating a real risk that decisions were made on incomplete records.

# Employee 2 – case against an employment agency (anonymised)  
## Evidence + timeline (ZIP) – GitHub version (EN)

> Public version: no first/last names.  
> In the text I use: **Employee 2**, **Agency [A]**, **Client/Worksite [B]**.  
> Institutions (FairWork, Juridisch Loket, SNCU) remain.

---

## 1) Context (short)
- **Phase C** contract with **32 hours/week guaranteed**.
- Issues: work planning, hours/payslips, negative “balance/minus”, settlements and deductions (incl. housing).
- Vacation dispute: written information/confirmation of vacation hours vs later refusal + pressure/intimidation.
- After resignation: dispute over final settlement and payments.
- Support path: **FairWork → Juridisch Loket → SNCU**.

---

## 2) Key issues supported by evidence
- **“Minus/debt” mechanism** (e.g., housing charges/settlements) when work is not planned despite a 32h guarantee.
- **Payroll corrections/administrative chaos** (late corrections, questions “where did you work”, delayed payments).
- **Vacation (61.11 hours)**: first confirmed in writing, later refused + pressure to attend work.
- **Resignation + disputed/missing final settlement** → formal **demand for payment**.
- **SNCU**: file closed after correspondence with the opposing party.
