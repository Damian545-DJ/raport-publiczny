# Timeline (TIMELINE) – public version (anonymized)

Dates and descriptions are based on our documentation and the evidence report. This public version is anonymized (no sensitive data and no identifying data of private individuals).

---

## 2023 – early 2024 (issues escalating)
- Increasing employment and payroll issues: dispute over deductions and the guaranteed hours framework (Phase C).
- Worker B was left without income for several months due to lack of work scheduling (per documentation).
- A “debt” for agency housing was accumulated during periods without scheduled work (per documentation).
- Meeting at Intrixo’s office where (according to audio recordings) pressure and intimidation were used to force signing documents detrimental to the worker.

---

## 12 March 2024 – court hearing (context)
- A court hearing took place.
- A €5,000 advance payment was reportedly obtained as part of the case (based on the document/account in the file).
- The court gave both parties time to submit accurate calculations.

---

## April 2024 – no closure and missing documents
- A meeting discussed a potential follow-up case regarding outstanding payroll settlements; there was no clear information about the closure of the previous case.
- The representative did not provide the **proces-verbaal** document (according to correspondence and the account in the file).

---

## 24 May 2024 – signal of a decision and “debt” repaid
- The accountant communicated information about a decision/judgment; during that period there was no effective contact with the representative.
- Worker B repaid the “debt” charged by the agency (authors’ assessment: unlawful under Dutch rules).

---

## June 2024 – new representative (MV Juridisch)
- First meeting at the end of June.
- Declared handling time: approx. 3 months.

---

## July 2024 – Helpdesk/planner (evidence of the debt mechanism)
- Intrixo (referencing NBBU certification) confirmed that with a Phase C contract (32h guarantee), if the agency does not schedule work, they charge the worker with a debt.  
  (Evidence: correspondence)

---

## Sept 2024 – 2025 and onward – no progress, contradictory claims
- Long periods without information/communication.
- Claim that documents could not be obtained from the previous lawyer.
- Later: claim that a settlement existed and “nothing can be done,” without providing the settlement document(s).
- Ultimately: no refund of paid fees and unclear invoices / additional payment requests without clear evidence of performed work (authors’ assessment: suspected improper billing/collection).

---

## 2025 – escalation and obtaining documents directly from court
- Complaint against the previous representative to the Orde van Advocaten, then a case before the Raad van Discipline and an appeal/objection.
- We obtained the **proces-verbaal** directly from the court ourselves, then sent further letters requesting:
  - case documents from the first representative,
  - compliance with the settlement terms from Intrixo,
  — with no response (per documentation).

---

# Worker 1 – evidence (short summary + timeline)

## 1) Debt mechanism caused by lack of work scheduling
- From **21 Nov 2022** (open-ended contract, Phase C, 32h guarantee), the agency’s failure to schedule work resulted in debt being built up on the worker (e.g., ongoing housing costs).
- When work was later assigned again, the “debt” was deducted from wages, significantly lowering net pay.
- In practice: systematic debt creation + recovery via deductions (the debt effectively persisted until **27 May 2024**).

Evidence: screenshots/messages – repeated requests for work scheduling.

---

## 2) Key dates (requests for scheduling / no response)
- **10 Apr 2023 (Planning):** request for a work plan — no reply  
- **13 Apr 2023 (Planning):** request for work in the coming days — no reply  
- **18 Sep 2023 (General):** question whether there will be work that week  
- **18 Sep 2023 (Helpdesk – K.):** “I forwarded this to planning.”  
- **22 Oct 2023 (General):** another week without work — question when work will be scheduled  
- **24 Oct 2023 (A.K.):** “Planners are doing everything they can to schedule you.”  
- **27 Oct 2023 (Salary/Payslip):** request for a payslip document (Solaris week 42)

---

## 3) Evidence events (meetings/recordings)
- **13 Nov 2023:** summoned to the agency office (recording)  
- **30 Jan 2024:** summoned again (recording)  
- **27 May 2024:** debt repaid

---

## 4) Findings regarding the debt
- From **24 Jul 2023** work was barely scheduled and the debt increased.
- **25 Sep 2023:** debt approx. €1,000; once work resumed, deductions started.

---

## 5) External support and representatives (short)
### Representative 1
- **12/2023:** contact via accountant; recommendation of representative 1  
- **12 Mar 2024:** hearing; calculations; Intrixo pays €5,000; court sets deadline for accurate calculations  
- **04/2024:** meeting; no document transfer; meeting planned end of May  
- **24–30 May 2024:** no contact / holiday explanation  
- **23 Jun 2024:** considering changing representative due to no contact

### Representative 2 (MV Juridisch)
- **25 Jun 2024:** transfer of **€1,512.50** (FR2024-1127) to “M. Nieruchomości Investment B.V.”  
- Promise to finish within **3–4 months**  
- **07–09/2024:** no real progress; difficult contact  
- Autumn 2024: **proces-verbaal** obtained by us from the court; MV Juridisch did not obtain court documents (per account)  
- **12/2024 – 01/2025:** requests for clarification/refund; refusal; dispute about final billing

---

## 6) WhatsApp correspondence with MV Juridisch
- MV Juridisch relied on information “from management/the other side” that a settlement existed and “cannot be broken.”
- Suggestion appears that the representative “misled” and that “there is no appeal” (authors’ view: inconsistent with missing documents and the fact we had to obtain key documents ourselves).
- Throughout 2025 we continued requesting copies of court documents and the case status.

# Worker 2 – evidence (short summary + timeline)

Public version: no names. Labels used: **Worker 2**, **Agency [A]**, **Client/company [B]**. Institutions (FairWork, Juridisch Loket, SNCU) remain named.

## 1) Context
- Phase C / 32h weekly guarantee.
- Issues: work scheduling, hour calculations, payslip corrections, balance/“minus”, deductions (incl. housing).
- Holiday dispute: written confirmation of holiday hours vs later refusal + pressure/intimidation.
- After resignation: dispute over final settlement and payment.
- Support path: FairWork → Juridisch Loket → SNCU.

## 2) Key issues (basis of evidence)
- “Minus/debt” mechanism when work is not scheduled under the 32h guarantee.
- Corrections/chaos in settlements (late corrections, delayed payments, questions “where did you work”).
- Holiday (61.11 h): first confirmed in writing, later denied with pressure to work.
- Resignation + no complete final settlement → formal payment demand.
- SNCU: procedure closed after correspondence with the employer/other side.

## 3) Timeline (with file references)
Note: screenshot file dates = date of screenshot; inside screenshots the message dates are often visible.

### June 2024 – scheduling / no work

- 
**18–19 Jul 2024 – “minus” / housing debt (Solaris) confirmed by Helpdesk**  
The worker reported a “minus” shown in the system. Helpdesk explained that in week 26 only **7:45 hours** were worked, which was insufficient to cover **housing + insurance**, so the system recorded **€50.98** as housing debt. In week 27 **€33.45** was deducted, leaving a remaining balance of **€17.53**.  

### July–Aug 2024 – payslip dispute and corrections (week 29)
- **31 Jul–01 Aug 2024:** questions “where did you work”; correction announced and later payment
