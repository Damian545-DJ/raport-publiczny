  # Evidence – start of the case (summary + timeline)

## 1) Debt mechanism caused by lack of work planning
From **21.11.2022** (indefinite contract, **Phase C**, **32h guarantee**), the agency created debt on the employee’s side by **not scheduling work** (e.g., while **housing costs** kept being charged).  
When work was later assigned again, this “debt” was **deducted from wages**, resulting in much lower payouts.  
In practice: **systematic creation of debt + recovery through deductions** (the debt remained in place practically until **27.05.2024**).

**Evidence:** screenshots/messages – repeated requests to schedule work.

## 2) Key dates (requests for planning / no response)
- **10.04.2023 (Planning):** question about work schedule — no response  
- **13.04.2023 (Planning):** question about work in the coming days — no response  
- **18.09.2023 (General):** question whether there will be work this week  
  - **18.09.2023 (Helpdesk – K.):** “I forwarded the information to the planning department.”
- **22.10.2023 (General):** another week without work — question when work will be available  
  - **24.10.2023 (A.K.):** “Planners are doing everything they can to schedule you.”
- **27.10.2023 (Salary/Payslip):** request for payroll document (Solaris week 42)

## 3) Evidence events (meetings/recordings)
- **13.11.2023:** summoned to the agency office (recording)
- **30.01.2024:** summoned again to the office (recording)
- **27.05.2024:** debt paid off

## 4) Findings regarding the debt
- From **24.07.2023** work was hardly scheduled at all, and the debt kept increasing.
- **25.09.2023** debt approx. **€1,000**; when work resumed, the agency started deductions.

### Lawyer 2 (MV Juridisch)

- Promise to finalize within 3–4 months

- 12/2024 – 01/2025 – requests for clarification/refund; refusal to refund, dispute about settlement of fees

## 6) Correspondence with MV Juridisch (WhatsApp) – attachments
- MV Juridisch relied on information “from management / the other side” that a settlement was concluded and “cannot be broken,”
- there is a suggestion that the representative “misled” and that “there is no appeal,” while we still lacked documents and clear explanations, and we ultimately had to obtain key documents ourselves,
- in 2025 we still request a copy of court documents and a proper case status.
