## A) Intrixo B.V. – alleged labour-law and standards violations

### 1. Pay during no-work periods / guaranteed hours
- **Dutch Civil Code (BW), Book 7, art. 7:628** – entitlement to wages in certain “no work, still wages” situations where the cause lies with the employer (general rule).
- **BW, Book 7, art. 7:610b** – statutory presumption of working hours (after at least 3 months: the agreed working time in a given month is presumed to match the average of the previous 3 months).
- **EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, art. 31** – fair and just working conditions.

### 2. Late wage payments
- **BW, Book 7, art. 7:625** – statutory increase (“penalty”) for late wage payment (maximum **50%**, and the court may reduce it).

### 3. Holidays (leave) and holiday pay
- **BW, Book 7, art. 7:639–641** – paid leave and calculation rules for holiday pay.
- **EU Charter, art. 31(2)** – right to an annual period of paid leave.

### 4. Holiday allowance (8%)
- **Minimum Wage and Minimum Holiday Allowance Act (WML), art. 15** – minimum holiday allowance (generally **at least 8%**).

### 5. Housing deductions
- **WML/WAS rules + implementing regulations**: housing deductions from (the part of) the minimum wage are only permitted under strict conditions, with a **maximum of 25% of the gross minimum wage** (e.g., written authorisation/power of attorney from the worker, and quality/certification requirements for the accommodation).

### 6. Data accuracy / payroll records integrity
- **GDPR, art. 5(1)(d)** – the **accuracy** principle: personal data must be accurate and kept up to date where necessary.

### 7. Privacy in agency accommodation / entering a locked, occupied room
- Reference to **privacy and safety standards** and the general principle that entering occupied living space without consent/prior notice requires strong justification and proper procedures (in the report supported by video evidence).

## B) Legal representatives – diligence, information duties, and file handover

### 1. Missing documents / lack of information
- Professional standards for legal services: **timely and clear information**, acting in the **client’s best interests**, and **handing over the file/case documents** so the client (or a new representative) can verify what happened and continue the matter.
- European rule-of-law standard: the right to an **effective remedy** and **real access to legal protection**.

> Note: in the public version we describe facts and evidence. Legal qualification (disciplinary liability/breach of contract) should be confirmed by an independent lawyer.

## C) SNCU – role of the monitoring body and our points regarding the handling

### STATUS (24-01-2026)
This section is **preliminary** and may be updated after receiving a (further) response from SNCU. Until then, we describe only what is supported by documents and correspondence.

### SNCU role and mandate (what it is and what it is expected to do)
- **SNCU** (Foundation for Compliance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Agency Workers) monitors compliance with CAO rules in the agency work sector (including **ABU CAO / NBBU CAO**) and can investigate based on reports/signals.
- According to SNCU’s described process, a key step is obtaining **payroll administration data** and verifying CAO compliance against verifiable records.
- Input material for a control process should be **concrete, verifiable, and traceable**; otherwise the control loses its meaning.
