## A) Intrixo B.V. – alleged labour-law and standards violations

### 1. Pay during no-work periods / guaranteed hours
- **Dutch Civil Code (BW), Book 7, art. 7:628** – entitlement to wages in certain “no work, still wages” situations where the cause lies with the employer (general rule).
- **BW, Book 7, art. 7:610b** – statutory presumption of working hours (after at least 3 months: the agreed working time in a given month is presumed to match the average of the previous 3 months).
- **EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, art. 31** – fair and just working conditions.

### 2. Late wage payments
- **BW, Book 7, art. 7:625** – statutory increase (“penalty”) for late wage payment (maximum **50%**, and the court may reduce it).

### 3. Holidays (leave) and holiday pay
- **BW, Book 7, art. 7:639–641** – paid leave and calculation rules for holiday pay.
- **EU Charter, art. 31(2)** – right to an annual period of paid leave.

### 4. Holiday allowance (8%)
- **Minimum Wage and Minimum Holiday Allowance Act (WML), art. 15** – minimum holiday allowance (generally **at least 8%**).

### 5. Housing deductions
- **WML/WAS rules + implementing regulations**: housing deductions from (the part of) the minimum wage are only permitted under strict conditions, with a **maximum of 25% of the gross minimum wage** (e.g., written authorisation/power of attorney from the worker, and quality/certification requirements for the accommodation).

### 6. Data accuracy / payroll records integrity
- **GDPR, art. 5(1)(d)** – the **accuracy** principle: personal data must be accurate and kept up to date where necessary.

### 7. Privacy in agency accommodation / entering a locked, occupied room
- Reference to **privacy and safety standards** and the general principle that entering occupied living space without consent/prior notice requires strong justification and proper procedures (in the report supported by video evidence).

## B) Legal representatives – diligence, information duties, and file handover

### 1. Missing documents / lack of information
- Professional standards for legal services: **timely and clear information**, acting in the **client’s best interests**, and **handing over the file/case documents** so the client (or a new representative) can verify what happened and continue the matter.
- European rule-of-law standard: the right to an **effective remedy** and **real access to legal protection**.

> Note: in the public version we describe facts and evidence. Legal qualification (disciplinary liability/breach of contract) should be confirmed by an independent lawyer.

## C) SNCU – role of the monitoring body and our points regarding the handling

### SNCU role and mandate (what it is and what it is expected to do)
- **SNCU** (Foundation for Compliance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Agency Workers) monitors compliance with CAO rules in the agency work sector (including **ABU CAO / NBBU CAO**) and can investigate based on reports/signals.
- According to SNCU’s described process, a key step is obtaining **payroll administration data** and verifying CAO compliance against verifiable records.
- Input material for a control process should be **concrete, verifiable, and traceable**; otherwise the control loses its meaning.

## C) SNCU — serious procedural shortcomings, no genuine audit, and de facto erosion of workers’ rights protection (EU standards)

**STATUS (02.02.2026):** This section is based on documents and correspondence. We do not speculate about SNCU’s intentions. We describe facts and standards. Lack of response/transparency is itself an evidentiary event.

### 1) The role of SNCU — what “control” must be (and what it must not become)
SNCU only makes sense if it operates as a data-based control body, i.e., it verifies compliance with the sector CAO by reviewing source data (e.g., payroll administration, roster/planning, time registration, leave records).

SNCU must not operate as:
- an “employer mailbox”,
- an administrative filter that closes a case after one employer reply,
- a mechanism where the complainant receives no response and cannot know what was checked.

If the “check” ends at “the employer says everything is fine”, then it is **not control** — it is **the appearance of control**.

### 2) No reply to the complainant = no transparency and no minimum procedural standard
In case **SNCU----**, the complainant sent at least two formal letters:
- **13-01-2026** — request for status + identification of key contradictions and a demand for verification using source data,
- **22-01-2026** — reminder/request to reopen + demand for a list of verified documents and the complaint procedure.

No response was received — not even an acknowledgment of receipt. As a result, the process becomes a “black box”: the complainant does not know the scope of review, the basis of the decision, or whether any evidence was genuinely verified.

This conflicts with the minimum standard of effective legal protection and fair procedure under the **EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 47)**.

### 3) Operational model: contact the employer and “preliminary” closure without demonstrating source-data verification
From the materials relayed to the complainant via Juridisch Loket, it appears that SNCU:
- contacted the employer (Intrixo B.V.),
- closed the case at the “preliminary stage”,
- relied on the employer’s narrative (including the claim that work ended in week 31 / “did not return”).

In a dispute where the employer is an interested party, accepting a narrative without demonstrating verification of source data means that audit has been replaced by correspondence. That is a defective standard and results in **administrative shutdown** instead of genuine verification.

### 4) Evidence: payroll documents contradict the employer narrative and show retroactive “minus” corrections
This case contains contradictions that cannot be credibly closed without source verification:

**(a)** Employer narrative: “last day of work 28-07-2025 (week 31) / worker did not return”.

**(b)** A payroll document contradicts this: **loonspecificatie for Week 32 (2025)** shows pay period **04-08-2025 to 10-08-2025** and **Contracturen: 32:00 per week**. This is inconsistent with “employment ended in week 31”.

**(c)** Retroactive correction and “minus”: **loonspecificatie for Week 8 (2025)** appears again much later (dated in August 2025), showing **Contracturen: 1:00 per week** and a negative **Netto te betalen** (e.g., -191.62). This strongly suggests a retroactive correction creating a negative balance/offset — particularly in the context of a dispute and formal settlement requests.

If payroll documents themselves show contradictions (Week 32 = 32:00) and retroactive minus corrections (Week 8 = 1:00 + negative net), then a “preliminary” closure based on the employer’s narrative is **not reliable and not credible**.

### 5) Evidence: 61.11 hours of leave — written approval → reversal → pressure
In the leave track, the evidentiary chain is:
- written information/approval for using **61.11 hours** of leave,
- later reversal/denial and pressure (“report to work or consequences”),
- formal notice and a demand for written confirmation.

This requires source verification: leave balance history, approvals/reversals, system logs, roster/planning, and work communication. Closing without such verification effectively accepts a mechanism where paid leave can be “undone” after the fact.

### 6) EU standards: rights must be effective in practice (not “on paper”)
Relevant EU standards include:
- **Article 31(2) CFR**: right to rest and paid annual leave,
- **Directive 2003/88/EC (Article 7)**: minimum paid leave standard,
- **Directive 2008/104/EC**: protection and equal treatment of temporary agency workers in basic working conditions,
- **Directive (EU) 2019/1152**: transparent and predictable working conditions,
- **Article 47 CFR**: effective remedy and fair procedure.

If a control body does not reply, does not disclose what was checked, and closes a case relying on the employer’s position despite documentary contradictions, then workers’ rights become unenforceable in practice.

### 7) Minimum data package for an honest verification (without this, conclusions are not credible)
For a proper assessment, SNCU (or a state authority) must obtain and verify at minimum:
- full payroll administration with correction history (who/when/why/what changed),
- roster/planning at least for weeks 31–32,
- time registration (actual hours),
- leave records + logs (balance, approvals/reversals, change history),
- explanation/audit: why Week 32 shows 32:00 against the “end in week 31” narrative,
- explanation/audit: why Week 8 shows 1:00, negative net, and was processed later,
- rules and calculations behind deductions/negative balances (including housing/insurance), including calculation logic.

### Final conclusion (maximally firm, fact-based)
In this case, SNCU did not perform a genuine, verifiable audit: the complainant received no response, and the case was closed “preliminarily” based on the employer narrative despite contradictions in payroll documents (**Week 32 = 32:00**) and despite retroactive minus corrections (**Week 8 = 1:00 + negative net**) and despite leave evidence (**61.11h: approval → reversal → pressure**). This operational model shuts down complaints before any meaningful source-data verification — contrary to EU standards.
