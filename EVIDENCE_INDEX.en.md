[English version]
Evidence index (EVIDENCE_INDEX)

This file is a template and index. In the public version, do not publish raw personal data or full documents containing sensitive information.
Instead, publish only: excerpts after permanent anonymization and/or metadata (e.g., dates, payroll week numbers, document type). Full materials should be shared only with competent institutions/legal representatives upon request and not published publicly.

Privacy note: in the public version we do not publish faces/voices or any other elements that could identify private individuals. We also remove file metadata (e.g., photo EXIF, author/computer identifiers in PDFs).

Evidence categories
- Payslips / loonstroken (analysis of hours, deductions, allowances, leave balances and payouts)
- Audio recordings (meetings/calls — description of the situation, including disputed requests or perceived pressure; public version: no identification of individuals)
- Video recordings (events related to entry into room/housing; date and time visible in the footage; public version: no identification of individuals)
- Correspondence (emails, letters to institutions, replies/no replies)
- Court documents (e.g., proces-verbaal / confirmations of deadlines/agreements)
